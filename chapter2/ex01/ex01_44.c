/* Comment */
/* The only special treatment of operator within printf is the modulus due to the format string, where we are obliged to use percentage sign and letter(s) for printf chars. So, the %% because a single % is a special character in printfâ€”it introduces a format specifier (like %i for integer). To actually use modulus (%) you literally type %% */
