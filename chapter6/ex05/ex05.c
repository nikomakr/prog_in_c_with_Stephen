/* Chapter6 Ex05 You developed Program 5.9 to reverse the digits of an integer typed infrom the terminal. However, this program does not function well if you type in a negative number. Find out what happens in such a case and then modify the program so that negative numbers are correctly handled. For example, if the number âˆ’8645 is typed in, the output of the program should be 5468 */
